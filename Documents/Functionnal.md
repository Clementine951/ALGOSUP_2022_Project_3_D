# Functionnal Specification

## Goals
For this project we have to create a programmable synthesizer in F#, it is basically an electronic musical instrument that generates audio signals. With our programmable synthesizer, the user will be able to create sounds by generating waveforms from f# code.

Deadline: 11 of February 2022

  - We have created this application following the request of Robert Pickering.
  - All the code will be accessible on GitHub.

  The project is developed with F#.

  
## Requirements 
To run this project you will need an IDE, we have chosen to use [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/download). 
You should also install [dotnet](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download)

Once you have cloned our [project](https://github.com/Clementine951/ALGOSUP_2022_Project_3_D) and opened it in the IDE of your choice (we used Visual Studio Code), open the terminal and enter the following commands:

``` cd AudioSynth```

This command puts you in the file AudioSynth.

Then type this command to run the project :

``` dotnet run```

This command runs our project.

If you want just run our test you can type the ``` dotnet test``` command.

## Product overview 
This project is for anyone with or without knowledge of music or programming.

With our synthesizer, the user will be able to create a song with code and save his song, add some filters like echo only with code.

## Error reporting 
This program will have UnitTest to avoid errors or exceptions.
