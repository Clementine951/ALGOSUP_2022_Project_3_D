# Technical specification


## Context 
Robert Pieckering asked us to create a library that can be used to create, modify, play and listen a sound. The user will also be able to choose whether or not to save the sound.

Our project is available on [Github](https://github.com/Clementine951/ALGOSUP_2022_Project_3_D). You can clone it and test it if you have an IDE (We use [visual studio community](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/fr/vs/community/)) and [Dotnet](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download).


## Team
We have a team of six members, Clémentine Curel, Laura-Lee Hollande, Salahedine Namir, Gaël Lebrun, Guillaume Riviere, Victor Leroy.
