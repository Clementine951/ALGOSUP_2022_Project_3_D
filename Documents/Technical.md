# Technical specification


## Context 
Robert Pieckering asked us to create a library that can be used to create, modify, play and listen a sound. The user will also be able to choose whether or not to save the sound.

Our project is available on [Github](https://github.com/Clementine951/ALGOSUP_2022_Project_3_D). You can clone it and test it if you have an IDE (We use [visual studio community](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/fr/vs/community/)) and [Dotnet](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download).


## Team
We have a team of six members, Clémentine Curel, Laura-Lee Hollande, Salahedine Namir, Gaël Le Brun, Guillaume Rivière, Victor Leroy.

## Technical

### Generate Wave

  #### Wavegen
    This module is here in order to create a wave who will be related to a sound later.
        ``` let calcSin sampleRate time freq amp= ``` 
        - sampleRate *(Float)* correspond to the sample rate you want for your sound to be
        - time *(Float)* correspond to the duration the wave will last
        - freq *(Float)* relate to the frequency of the sound generated by the wave
        - amp *(Float)* is the amplitude of the wave (from 0 = silence to 1 = max sound)
    ```
        let calcSin sampleRate time freq amp=
            let t = 1. + (1./sampleRate) 
            let N = sampleRate * time 
            let omega = 2. * System.Math.PI * freq 


            let points = [(0.)..t..N] 
            let points = points |> List.map(fun x -> amp * sin(omega*x) ) 
            points
    ```
    There is the full function to make Sine wave. Triangle, Sawtooth and Square have the same architecture, only the formula is different.

        - t is equal to determine the interval betwwen 2 X axis points based on sample rate
        - N is the numbers of points we need based on the time we need to play the note and the sample rate
        - omega is a part of the calculation that is a common on multiple formula

        - points is first the list of X axis points with an increment of t (See above for t)
        - Then the formula is applied to all the list to convert X axis value to convert to Y axis value that now will be a Wave

      This explaination works the same for each waves forms.

      The functions available to generate wave are :
      ```let calcSin sampleRate time freq amp=``` generate a Sine wave
      ```let calcSquare sampleRate time freq amp =``` generate a Square wave
      ```let calcTri sampleRate time freq amp =``` generate a Triangle wave
      ```let calcSaw sampleRate time freq amp =``` generate a Sawtooth wave


  #### NoteToHz

   NoteToHz module is composed of 3 main parts, 
    - First the part to convert Note and Octave to a specific Hz
    - Second, Since we have Tuple in the third part, we have a way to acess tuples specific part
    - Third and last, a way to convert a list of notes to a list of float making a list of waves


  #### Filters

    Filters are here to add some modifications on the wave.

  ##### Amplitude

    You can change the amplitude of your wave by using this function :
    ```
    let amplitude (initialList:list<float>) (amp:float) =
    ```
    initialList is the wave generated earlier as a List of float
    amplitude mean the mutiplier of the amplitude the wave already have, going over 1 will make the amplitude higher and under 1 will reduce the amplitude


  ##### Overdriven
  ##### Echo
  ##### Reverb
  ##### Flange



  #### Save

    ``` save.write stream Wave = ```

    This is the way of calling the function to save a file.
      - stream is the parameter with the file name, it's an object ( See below )
      - Wave is the list offloat who have been fully proceed with various filters

    ``` let stream = File.Create(@"test.wav") ```
    This is the way of declaring the stream parameter seen above. 
    The name of the file is define as a string.


  #### Play

    They are two ways to play a wave. 
    The first one is to save the sound before playing it.
    ```
    let playSound (name:string,save:bool,time:float32) =
    ```
    The first argument is a string as the name of the file
    The second is a bool as the save
    And the third one is a float32 as the starting time
      You can start the sound at where you want by changing the arguments of time.

    The second way to play a wave is to save it, play it and then delete it.
    This way is here to not use too much local storage.
    To play this way, it's like the first way but you define save as false.
