## ALGOSUP_2022_Project_3_D

The aim of this project is to create a sound synthesizer that can be used to create programmable music. 
This project was inspired by Sonic Pi (https://sonic-pi.net/) and other live coding music packages. 
The ultimate aim of this project is to be able to play music from code that looks something like the code given below.
