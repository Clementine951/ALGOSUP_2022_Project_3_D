## ALGOSUP_2022_Project_3_D

The aim of this project is to create a sound synthesizer that can be used to create programmable music. 
This project was inspired by Sonic Pi (https://sonic-pi.net/) and other live coding music packages. 
The ultimate aim of this project is to be able to play music from code that looks something like the code given below.

Our team consists of 6 people. Clémentine Curel, Laura-Lee Hollande, Salaheddine Namir, Guillaume Rivière, Gaël Lebrun and Victor Leroy.

We chose Clémentine Curel as Project Manager for this project, and Guillaume Rivière as Tech Leader.
